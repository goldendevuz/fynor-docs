Fynor is a Python Web Framework built for learning purposes. The plan is to learn how frameworks are built by
implementing their features, writing blog posts about them and keeping the codebase as simple as possible.

It is a WSGI framework and can be used with any WSGI application server such as Gunicorn.

## Inspiration

I was inspired to make a web framework after reading [Jakhongir Rakhmonov](https://t.me/jakhonrakhmonov)'s blog post
about how he built a web framework and became an open source maintainer.
